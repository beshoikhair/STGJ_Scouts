        Baden Powell, full name Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, was a
        British Army officer, writer, and founder of the worldwide Scouting
        movement. He was born on February 22, 1857, in London, England, and died
        on January 8, 1941. Powell's military career took him to various parts
        of the British Empire, where he developed a keen interest in outdoor
        skills, survival techniques, and leadership qualities. His experiences
        inspired him to write the book "Scouting for Boys," which was published
        in 1908 and laid the foundation for the Boy Scout movement. Powell's
        vision for Scouting emphasized self-reliance, teamwork, and moral
        values, aiming to prepare young people for responsible citizenship. His
        legacy continues to thrive today, with millions of Scouts around the
        world embracing his principles and ideals. Baden Powell's contributions
        to youth development and outdoor education are widely recognized and
        celebrated.

        Last Message of Baden Powell
      </h3>
      <div class="last-message-baden-powell-text">
        <p>
          "Dear Scouts, if you have ever seen the play 'Peter Pan,' you will
          remember how the pirate chief was always making his dying speech
          because he was afraid that possibly when the time came for him to die,
          he might not have time to get it off his chest. It is much the same
          with me, and so, although I am not at this moment dying, I shall be
          doing so one of these days and I want to send you a parting word of
          goodbye. Remember, it is the last you will ever hear from me, so think
          it over. I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to
          have as happy a life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly
          world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being
          rich, nor merely from being successful in your career, nor by
          self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself
          healthy and strong while you are a boy so that you can be useful and
          so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you
          how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for
          you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of
          it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But
          the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other
          people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and
          when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any
          rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. 'Be
          Prepared' in this way, to live happy and to die happy â€“ stick to your
          Scout Promise always - even after you have ceased to be a boy - and
          God help you to do it. Your friend, Baden-Powell"

      <div class="scouts-second-world-war-text">
        <p>
          During the Second World War, Scouts world wide played a crucial role
          in supporting their communities and nations. They participated in
          civil defense efforts, fundraising for the war, and acted as message
          carriers and couriers when communication systems were disrupted.
          Scouts also contributed to recycling and salvage efforts, engaged in
          agricultural work, provided first aid and medical assistance, and
          played roles in resistance movements against occupying forces. They
          maintained the Scouting spirit and offered assistance to refugees
          while actively participating in post-war reconstruction. Scouts
          exemplified the values of preparedness, service, and community
          involvement during this tumultuous period.
